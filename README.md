This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Supabase authentication setup

Authentication is powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). Provide the following environment variables before starting the development server:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY"
```

Only email / password sign-in is enabledâ€”user registration should be managed directly from the Supabase dashboard. Once the environment variables are configured and the dev server is running, visit `/login` to authenticate and access the protected chatbot interface.
